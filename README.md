# Analyzing Social Media and Emotions

### Group Members:
Zialn Yildiz, Jennifer Vega, Daniel Cabrera, Cindy Duong

### Introduction:
We are a group of data analysts exploring the data on the usage of social media and emotional well-being. Social media has grown to become part of our modern day-to-day lives having an influence over various aspects of our emotional well-being. We will be analyzing demographic factors (age, gender), social media platform statistical factors (platform app, usage time, activity type), and emotional state factors (Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Anxiety, Boredom, Neutral).  We seek to understand the relationship, if any, that may exist between these variables while also acknowledging that we are not experts and can only draw conclusions about the information in this dataset. This analysis will explore the dataset over platform activity and usersâ€™ emotional state, discuss our thought process of exploration, and include any conclusions found.

### Language: 
Python (with )

### Data Sources:



Please see Final Project folder which includes our written analysis, our presentation, our jupyter notebook that cleans the raw data as well as our second jupyter notebook for our analysis, tables, and charts.
The Images folder consists of all of our images, generated from Python, utilized for our presentation, and findings for conclusions. The folder is broken down by individual group member.
The Data Folder consists of the raw data, called 'train.CSV', that was pulled from Kaggle.
Daniel's_work, Jennifer's_work, Zilan's_work, and Cindy's_work consist of each group member's jupyter notebooks. Each folder will have the group member's own work for their contribution to the analysis. 
The cleaned data is under Jennifer's_work called 'Clean_CSV'.
